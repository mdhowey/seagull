# Seagull

## Description

Seagull is a social network that provides travel tips to it's users. Users can authenticate in, add travel tips, view travel tips, and comment on other users travel tips.	

### The tech stack: 
The team and I utilized Bootstrap with Django for frontend, Python for backend, and PostgreSQL for database.

## Usage

Users are able to create accounts --> email and password is used for login.

Users are able to: 
  1) create and edit their profile
  2) add, view, edit, and delete their own travel tips to the corresponding cities page
  3) view cities and the comments associated with them from different users

At this time (10-12-21), users are not able to friend each other and see other user's profiles.** 

**See Roadmap below for more information on the future of the project.
